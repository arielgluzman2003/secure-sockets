About:
	class secureServer implements RSA encryption method using Pycrypto, rsa and pickle tools.
	secureServer follows the usage of network sockets of the higher layer-hierarchy, identically,
	the return values, and functionality its values remind of those of the default 'socket' library.
	->	i.e. to bind() the socket, listen(), and accept() a client connection.
	
	with that being said the major difference apart from the encryption, that is mentioned previously,
	is that server and client have two different classes, which are one at default 'socket' library,
	therefore an important thing to notice while using secureServer is that the return-type that is
	returned with 'secureServer.accept()' is a 'secureClient()'.
	
	'secureServer()' is merely a tool for connecting to clients with an addition of the RSA protocol,
	after recieving an encryption key from client, it immediately returns a 'secureClient()',
	and waits for as many clients defined to be able to at 'secureServer.listen()'
	
	**Warning: secure_sockets(secureServer/secureClient) use AES mode ECB, which deficiency is encryption
	of pictures which can still be understood post encryption, therefore 'secure_sockets' should not be
	used for encryption of photos.
